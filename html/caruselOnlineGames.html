                  <p class="descriere">Even though there are many action games that involve strategic thinking, they are seldom classified as strategy games.A strategy game is typically larger in scope, and their main emphasis is on the player's ability to outthink their opponent.Strategy games rarely involve a physical challenge, and tend to annoy strategically minded players when they do.Compared to other genres such as action or adventure games where one player takes on many enemies, strategy games usually involve some level of symmetry between sides. Each side generally has access to similar resources and actions, with the strengths and weaknesses of each side being generally balanced.</p>

Mastery of vehicle control is the element which encourages players to continue playing, even after the game's goals have been completed. Players learn to use appropriate speed and steering, and must avoid crashing by observing cues about how fast they are going.There are some vehicle games where the player is given no specific goal, and is simply able to explore and experience using the vehicle.In the absence of any competition, "some vehicle aren't games at all"</p>
